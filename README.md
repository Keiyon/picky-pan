# picky-pan
Welcome to our Picky-Pan project.  In this project, we used HTML, CSS, JS, Animated.css, Materialize.css, a formspree, and an API key from Edamam website.

At the top right of the page are four different links to click on. 

When you first open the website, you will be directed to the home page of the project.  You will notice that the words are brought down from the top to the bottom of the page.  This was done by using Animate.css.  The background gif was found off of google images.

The second link, About Us, directs you to a new page that describes the type of environment that Picky-Pan is and what is to be expected while working there.  The text of the About Us page also uses Animate.css to bring all of the content from the top to the bottom of the page.

The third link, Recipe, directs you to a new page where all of the magic happens.  On this page, you have the ability to search different recipes as well as filter out any dietary restrictions that fits you. We created ten different API keys from the website, "https://developer.edamam.com/", that will generate up to 500 searches. After searching for a specific food, that food's image will display on a card as well as the calories, fat, pritein, and sodium content of that food item.

The fourth link, Contact Us, directs you to a new page where the user can fill out their first name, last name, email, and a message. In order to store this data, we used 'Formspree' which allowed us to fill out the necessary information.
