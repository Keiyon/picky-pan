        <p class="About Me">At Picky-Pan, we all arrive to work with a healthy, prosperous mindset. We are a newly emerged
            business that was started up in August 2018. One of the biggest problems out there is that there are not many
            websites that provide you with the ability to filter out certain food options to receive ingredients, nutritional
            values, and total meal preparation time. This has created a lot of opportunity for us and a desirable mission.
            We believe that there are more proficient ways to market the consumers of the food industry, specifically targeting
            those with dietary restrictions. A few of us have dietary restrictions ourselves, thus allowing us to be more
            passionate when it comes to designing an application to target others with similar needs. We are excited for
            everyone to experience our community and most importantly our software. </p>
