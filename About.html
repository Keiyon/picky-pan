            <p class="about col s12">At Picky-Pan, we all arrive to work with a healthy and prosperous mindset. We are a newly
                emerged
                company that was started in August 2018. One of the major problems we have encountered is there are not
                many
                websites that provide you with the ability to filter out food options to view ingredients, nutritional
                values,
                and total meal preparation time. This has created an opportunity for us and thus our company's mission.
                We believe
                that there are more proficient ways to market to consumers of the food industry, specifically targeting
                those
                with dietary restrictions. A few of us have dietary restrictions ourselves, thus allowing us to be more
                passionate
                when it comes to designing an application to target others with similar needs. We are excited for
                everyone to
                experience our community and more importantly, our software. </p>
