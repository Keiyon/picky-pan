    <p class="About Me">At Picky-Pan, we all arrive to work with a healthy and prosperous mindset. We are a newly emerged
        company that was started in August 2018. One of the major problems we have encountered is there are not many
        websites that provide you with the ability to filter out food options to view ingredients, nutritional values,
        and total meal preparation time. This has created an opportunity for us and thus our company's mission. We believe
        that there are more proficient ways to market to consumers of the food industry, specifically targeting those
        with dietary restrictions. A few of us have dietary restrictions ourselves, thus allowing us to be more passionate
        when it comes to designing an application to target others with similar needs. We are excited for everyone to
        experience our community and more importantly, our software. </p>
